				<p>A lot of us have played music together before...but we
				decided we needed more horns!</p>
                <p>This lead to the forming of <em>DIDDY vs THE KINGDOM</em>, a 9 piece ska
                influenced band from Leeds in the UK. The band is made up of friends from primary school, high school and beyond.</p>
                <p>We share a love of energetic music and geek culture, having played video and board games together since a young age.</p>
                <p>Most of us have gigged together in the past, but this is the first time some of us have come together for well over a decade.</p>
