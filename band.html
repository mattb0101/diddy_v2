			<h1>MEET THE BAND!</h1>
		</div>

		<section class="band-info">
			<div>
				<p>A lot of us have played music together before...but we
					decided we needed more horns!</p>
				<p>This lead to the forming of <em>DIDDY vs THE KINGDOM</em>, a 9 piece ska
					influenced band from Leeds in the UK. The band is made up of friends from primary school, high
					school and beyond.</p>
				<p>We share a love of energetic music and geek culture, having played video and board games together
					since a young age.</p>
				<p>Most of us have gigged together in the past, but this is the first time some of us have come together
					for well over a decade.</p>
				<p><i class="fas fa-music"></i> And boy is it fun!</p>

		<!--Band Member selection tried to emulate Mario Kart character selection, wouldnt do exactly what was needed without JavaScript so changed the layout a bit. Everyones face, cut out and tried to look cartoony, not quite there with my photo editing skills, hopefully a future addition.-->
